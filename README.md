# Array practice
## Getting started:
- All testing is done in the terminal
- Fork the repo and "npm i " in VSCode terminal to get started
- Tests are in the files with .test, the functions you will complete are in array.js and array-map.js files
- remove the ```.skip``` from the describe block you want to test
- run "npm run test:watch" in VSCode terminal to run tests
